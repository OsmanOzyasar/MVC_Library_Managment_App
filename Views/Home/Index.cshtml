            Library Management System provides a comprehensive system for managing books and authors. It allows users to add new books to the system, along with detailed information about each book such as title, genre, and publication year. Each book is associated with an author, and users can view detailed author profiles that include their name, biography, and a list of all books they have written. Additionally, the application enables users to browse books by individual authors, making it easy to explore an author's entire body of work. The system is designed to facilitate efficient book and author management, offering an intuitive interface for users to interact with.
